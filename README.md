# MyReads Project
This project is a books app where there is a main page to list the books which are placed in their respective shelves.There is also a search page which lists upto 20 books at a time based on the query typed in the input field.Some of the functionalities are that you can change the shelves of the books, can add books from the search page to the main page placing it in the right shelves.

## The Project

To get started please do the following steps:

1.Clone or download the starter repository

2. install all project dependencies with `npm install`

2. start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Resources

I have gone through some resources to do this project.The starting point was the freecodecamp react lessons which helped me a lot to understand the basic concepts.I completed all the lessons before starting the project and it really helped.I then went through the Udacity course material which guided me through the project.
